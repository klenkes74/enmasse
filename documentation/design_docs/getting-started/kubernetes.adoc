[[enmasse-on-kubernetes]]
= EnMasse on Kubernetes

This guide will walk through the process of setting up EnMasse on a
Kubernetes cluster together with clients for sending and receiving
messages. Some of the concepts like addresses and flavors are described
in more detail link:openshift.adoc[here]. Currently, TLS is not supported
on Kubernetes.

[[preqrequisites]]
== Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you already have a Kubernetes cluster installed.
If not, have a look at https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[minikube],
which is kind of kubernetes-in-a-box.

The address-controller and console is configured using ingress, so
enable the ingress controller in your minikube setup:

....
minikube addons enable ingress
....

This will cause an nginx ingress controller to get launched.

[[setting-up-enmasse]]
== Setting up EnMasse

[[creating-project-and-importing-template]]
=== Creating project and importing template

Download one of the releases from
https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/releases and unpack it. Once
unpacked, you can either deploy EnMasse using an automated script.

[[deploying-enmasse-automatically]]
==== Deploying EnMasse automatically

The deployment script simplifies the process of deploying the enmasse
cluster. You can invoke it with `-h` to get a list of options (you can also use `-g` to generate the
list of steps). To
deploy:

....
./deploy-kubernetes.sh -m "https://localhost:8443" -n enmasse
....

This will create the deployments required for running EnMasse. Starting
up EnMasse will take a while, usually depending on how fast it is able
to download the docker images for the various components. In the
meantime, you can start to create your address configuration.


[[role-based-access-control]]
==== Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

The Kubernetes deployment script and YAML files currently do not support Role
Based Access Control (RBAC). In Kubernetes clusters which have RBAC enabled, it is
required to additionally create a role binding for the `default` service account
to the `view` role and for the `enmasse-service-account` to the `cluster-admin` role:

....
kubectl create clusterrolebinding enmasse-service-account-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=enmasse:enmasse-service-account
kubectl create rolebinding default-view-binding --clusterrole=view --serviceaccount=enmasse:default -n enmasse
....

_Note: The `cluster-admin` role gives the `enmasse-service-account` service account unlimited access to the Kubernetes cluster._

[[deploying-external-load-balancers]]
=== Deploying external load balancers

If you're running EnMasse in your own Kubernetes instance on any of the
cloud providers, and if you don't have or don't want to deploy an
ingress controller, you can deploy the external load balancer services
to expose EnMasse ports:

....
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/addons/external-lb.yaml -n enmasse
....

[[configuring-addresses-using-the-console]]
=== Configuring addresses using the console

The EnMasse console should be available at `http://$(minikube ip)/`. You
can create and monitor queues and topics using the UI.

[[exposing-messaging-through-ingress-resource]]
=== Exposing messaging through Ingress resource

To open up for AMQP using minikube and the nginx ingress controller,
follow
https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx/examples/tcp[this]
and
https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress/tree/master/controllers/nginx#exposing-tcp-services[this]
guides, using the port `5672` and the service `default/messaging`.

[[sending-and-receiving-messages]]
=== Sending and receiving messages

For sending and receiving messages, have a look at an example python
http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-proton-0.15.0/proton/python/examples/simple_send.py.html[sender]
and
http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-proton-0.15.0/proton/python/examples/simple_recv.py.html[receiver].

To send and receive messages, you can use the minikube IP:

....
./simple_send.py -a "amqp://$(minikube ip):5672/myqueue" -m 10
....

This will send 10 messages. To receive:

....
./simple_recv.py -a "amqp://$(minikube ip):5672/myqueue" -m 10
....

You can use the client with the 'anycast' and 'broadcast' and 'mytopic'
addresses as well.

[[conclusion]]
== Conclusion

We have seen how to setup a messaging service in Kubernetes, and how to
communicate with it using python example AMQP clients.
