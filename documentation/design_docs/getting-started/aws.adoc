[[setting-up-enmasse-on-aws]]
= Setting up EnMasse on AWS

This guide walks you through setting up EnMasse on an AWS EC2 instance.
This is not even very specific to AWS, so you can probably modify the
configuration to fit Microsoft Azure or even Google GCE.

The end result from this guide is an instance of EnMasse suitable for
development and/or experimentation, and should not be considered a
production ready setup. For instance, no persistence is configured, so
neither messages in brokers nor state in other components like hawkular
are persisted.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

First, you must have created an https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[EC2
instance]. EnMasse runs on OpenShift and Kubernetes, but this post uses
OpenShift purely for convenience. Have a look at the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/install/prerequisites.html[OpenShift
prerequisites] for the required hardware configuration. The installation
will be done using https://www.ansible.com[Ansible], so make sure
Ansible is installed on laptop or workstation.

[[configure-ansible-to-handle-passwordless-sudo]]
=== Configure Ansible to handle passwordless sudo

For EC2 instance, the default is a passwordless sudo, and Ansible
(2.3.0.0 at the time of writing) requires a minor configuration
modification to deal with that. On the host you will be running ansible
from, edit /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, and make sure that the `sudo_flags`
parameter is set to `-H -S` (remove the `-n`).

[[setting-up-openshift]]
== Setting up OpenShift

Once Ansible is setup, installing OpenShift is easy. First, an inventory
file with the configuration and the hosts must be created. Save the
following configuration to a file, i.e. `ansible-inventory.txt`:

....
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes

[OSEv3:vars]
deployment_type=origin
openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider', 'filename': '/etc/origin/master/htpasswd'}]
openshift_master_default_subdomain=<yourdomain>
openshift_public_hostname=openshift.<yourdomain>
openshift_hostname=<ec2 instance hostname>
openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=hawkular-metrics.<yourdomain>

openshift_install_examples=false
openshift_hosted_metrics_deploy=true

[masters]
<ec2 host> openshift_scheduleable=true openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra'}"

[nodes]
<ec2 host> openshift_scheduleable=true openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra'}"
....

This will configure OpenShift so that it can only be accessed by users
defined in `/etc/origin/master/htpasswd`.

If you don't have a domain with wildcard support, you can replace with
.nip.io, and you will have a working setup without having a specialized
domain.

You can now download the ansible playbooks. The simplest way to do this
is to just clone the git repository:

....
git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.git
....

To install OpenShift, run the playbook like this

....
ansible-playbook -u ec2-user -b --private-key=<keyfile>.pem -i ansible-inventory.txt openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/config.yml
....

This command will take a while to finish.

[[creating-a-user]]
=== Creating a user

To be able to deploy EnMasse in OpenShift, a user must be created. Log
on to your EC2 instance, and create the user:

....
htpasswd -c /etc/origin/master/htpasswd <myuser>
....

Where `<myuser>` is the username you want to use. The command will
prompt you for a password that you will later use when deploying
EnMasse.

[[setting-up-enmasse]]
== Setting up EnMasse

You can find the latest version of EnMasse
https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/releases/latest[here]. To
deploy EnMasse, it is recommended to use the deploy script together with
a template of the latest version.

See http://enmasse.io/documentation/master/service_admin[service admin documentation] on how to deploy enmasse.

Once you've followed the above guide, you should have EnMasse deployed. The endpoints will be:

....
* AMQP: `messaging-enmasse.<yourdomain>`
* MQTT: `mqtt-enmasse.<yourdomain>`
* Console: `console-enmasse.<yourdomain>`
....

The console can be used for creating and deleting addresses. You should
be able to use any AMQP or MQTT client that supports TLS to send and
receive messages. Have a look at http://qpid.apache.org/[Apache Qpid]
for AMQP client libraries.

[[optional-setting-up-metrics]]
== (Optional) Setting up metrics

The process for setting up grafana is a bit more involved, but it gives
you a nice overview of whats going on over time. First of all, I like to
setup everything metric-related in the `openshift-infra` project. To do
that, you must first give your user permission sufficient privileges. In
this setup, since it's not a production setup, I grant cluster-admin
privileges for simplicity (requires logging into the ec2 instance):

....
oc adm --config /etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin developer
....

With this in place, you can setup the
https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent[hawkular-openshift-agent]
which pulls metrics from routers and brokers:

....
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin-metrics/master/hawkular-agent/hawkular-openshift-agent-configmap.yaml -n openshift-infra
oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin-metrics/master/hawkular-agent/hawkular-openshift-agent.yaml IMAGE_VERSION=1.4.0.Final | oc create -n openshift-infra -f -
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user hawkular-openshift-agent system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:hawkular-openshift-agent
....

If everything is setup correctly, you can then deploy
https://grafana.com/[Grafana]:

....
oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource/master/docker/openshift/openshift-template-ephemeral.yaml -n openshift-infra | oc create -n openshift-infra -f -
....

After some time, Grafana should become available at
`oc get route -n openshift-infra -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' hawkular-grafana`.
The default username and password is `admin/admin`. E
